Building the Root File System
=============================

This project builds a complete system image for booting PandA.  The following
components are built in turn:

* The U-Boot boot loader is built and assembled together with the Zynq stage-1
  boot loader.

* The Linux kernel is built.

* Two target root file systems are assembled: one for final system
  bootstrapping, one to act as the final system.


Build Dependencies
------------------

The following must be installed before building this project:

* Xilinx Zynq SDK.

* U-Boot and Linux kernel sources.  This project requires the Xilinx branches of
  these projects.

* The Diamond rootfs builder.  This can be downloaded from
  https://github.com/araneidae/rootfs

* Sources needed for rootfs build.  This list is quite long, see below.


Configuring ``CONFIG``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the build dependencies are configured in the file ``CONFIG``.  This
is designed to not be under version control.  Copy the file ``CONFIG.example``
and modify the following fields as required:

``PANDA_ROOT``:
    This is where the entire build occurs.  At least 2GB of storage must be free
    in this area.

``TAR_FILES``:
    All of the source files require to build the system will be looked for in
    this directory.  This can also be a list of directories if necessary.

``SDK_ROOT``:
    Location of the Xilinx SDK that will be used to build the system.

``ROOTFS_TOP``:
    This needs to point to the root directory of the Diamond rootfs builder,
    download from the github location given above.

Three files and directories are taken from ``SDK_ROOT``, and they can instead be
specified directly.  Note that in this case ``SDK_ROOT`` must *not* be set.

``BOOTGEN``
    This is the path to a Xilinx toolchain tool used to build the ``boot.bin``
    file.  By default this is set to ``$(SDK_ROOT)/bin/bootgen``.

``BINUTILS_DIR``
    This is the path to the gcc cross-compiler toolchain to use.  By default
    this is set to ``$(SDK_ROOT)/gnu/arm/lin``.  The directory
    ``$(BINUTILS_DIR)/bin`` will be added to the path during the build.

``SYSROOT``
    This is the path to the compiled system root (derived from libc).  Normally
    this is part of the installed toolchain, and if not set elsewhere this is
    set to ``$(BINUTILS_DIR)/$(COMPILER_PREFIX)/libc``.

Note that the ``COMPILER_PREFIX`` symbol can also be overwritten if required.
The default value is ``arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi``.

Sources
~~~~~~~

The rootfs requires a long list of dependencies that are freely available on the
web. They have been gathered together in one tar file here:

They consist of the following sources, listed below with their MD5 checksums::

These packages are used as follows in the build:

autoconf, automake, libtool, m4, pkg-config:
    The rootfs builder needs specific and up to date versions of these tools.

busybox:
    The entire target system environment is run with busybox.

e2fsprogs, mtd-utils:
    These packages are needed by the initramfs bootstrap process.

dropbear, ntp:
    These provide fundamental target resources: dropbear provides an ssh server,
    ntp is used for accurate timestamps.

Python, enum34, libressl, numpy, cothread, ws4py:
    Python and a variety of supporting libraries will be used for running a
    number of system components.

conserver, procServ, screen:
    It is possible that these may be used for server management.

ethtool, iperf, lsof, strace, nano:
    These are useful debugging utilities, together with an easy to use editor.

ncurses, readline, zlib:
    These are all libraries used by some of the packages above.



Output Files
------------

When built the following files are placed in ``$(BOOT_IMAGE)`` (see ``CONFIG``
to define this):

``boot.bin``:
    This file is loaded by the Zynq stage-0 boot loader and contains a standard
    stage 1 boot loader together with U-Boot, which acts as the stage-2 boot
    loader.

``uEnv.txt``:
    This is read by U-Boot to override a couple of default boot settings.

``uImage``:
    This is the Linux kernel image loaded by U-Boot.

``devicetree.dtb``:
    This is passed to the kernel to define the system hardware resources.

``uinitramfs``:
    This is the initial user-space system executed by the kernel.

``imagefile.cpio.gz``:
    This file will be used to prepare the initial state of the file system.

``config.txt``:
    This is designed to be user editable and contains network configuration
    settings.


Boot Process
------------

The boot process is as follows:

0.  The stage-0 boot loader is hard wired into Zynq.  This loads ``boot.bin``
    from the SD card into memory and executes the next step.

1.  The stage-1 boot loader loads U-Boot from the ``boot.bin`` file.

2.  The stage-2 boot loader is U-Boot.  This loads the kernel into memory
    together with the device tree and initial ram filesystem image.

3.  The kernel initialises hardware resources and then prepares the initial file
    system image loaded from ``uinitramfs``.  The init script in this image is
    executed.

4.  The initial init script checks the configuration and prompts for a MAC
    address if necessary, and repartitions the SD card if necessary before
    uncompressing ``imagefile.cpio.gz`` onto the target system.

5.  Finally the target system is executed.

Preparing SD for Install
------------------------

To install a fresh PandA system:

1.  Obtain a formatted empty SD card.  A minimum size of 2GB is recommended.
2.  Place the following files on the SD card (from rootfs build)::

        boot.bin    devicetree.dtb     uEnv.txt  uinitramfs
        config.txt  imagefile.cpio.gz  uImage

3.  Allocate MAC address to target system.  These need to be purchased in
    blocks.
4.  (Optionally) Write MAC address into a file named ``MAC`` on the SD card.


Panda System First Boot
-----------------------

It is wise to boot PandA for the first time with an connected serial console,
particularly if the MAC file has not been written.  If no MAC file has been
specified then on boot the serial console will prompt for a MAC address to be
specified::

    ------------------------------------
    Enter MAC address:

The SD card will then be repartitioned, the content of ``imagefile.cpio.gz``
will be installed and this file is deleted.

The installation process takes a couple of minutes or so, depending somewhat on
the speed of the SD card.

The serial port parameters are 115200n8.

PandA Packages (zpkg)
---------------------

zpkg files will be used for managing all application software.  A zpkg is
defined by the following:

* The name of a zpkg file must be of the form *package*\ ``@``\ *version*\
  ``.zpg``, where *package* is the package name and *version* identifies the
  package version.

* A zpkg file is simply a gzipped tar file containing files to be installed
  under ``/opt``.

* A startup script, if required, must be present in the zpkg under
  ``etc/init.d`` and linked from ``etc/rc.d``.


Installing zpkg Files
---------------------

There are two ways to maintain installed software:

1.  The simplest is via the Administration web page:

    * First place the ``.zpg`` files to install on a USB stick.
    * Insert USB stick into PandA
    * Select "Install zpg files from USB" from admin page
    * Navigate to appropriate location and select package(s) to install
    * Click on "Install Selected"

2.  Alternatively files can be copied directly to PandA and installed via a
    script, for example::

        scp panda-fpga@version.zpg root@panda:/tmp
        ssh root@panda zpkg install /tmp/panda-fpga@version.zpg


``zpkg`` Command
----------------

``zpkg list``
    Lists all installed packages

``zpkg install package ...``
    Installs or replaces named packages

``zpkg remove package ...``
    Removes named packages

``zpkg show package ...``
    Shows files in named packages

``zpkg verify package ...``
    Verifies files in named packages

``zpkg help``
    Show this list of options
